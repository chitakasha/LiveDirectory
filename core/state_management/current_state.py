Certainly! Below is a Python code snippet for `core/state_management/current_state.py`. This script contains functions to get and update the current state of the Live Directory.

```python
import json
import os

def get_current_state():
    """
    Retrieves the current state of the Live Directory from a JSON file.

    Returns:
        dict: The current state of the directory.
    """

    state_file_path = "data/state.json"

    # Check if the state file exists
    if not os.path.exists(state_file_path):
        # If not, return an empty state
        return {}

    # Load the current state from the JSON file
    with open(state_file_path, "r") as f:
        current_state = json.load(f)

    return current_state

def update_state(current_state, generated_text):
    """
    Updates the current state of the Live Directory based on the generated text.

    Parameters:
        current_state (dict): The current state of the directory.
        generated_text (str): The text generated by the autogen module.

    Returns:
        dict: The updated state of the directory.
    """

    # Update the state logic here
    # For demonstration, we'll just update a 'last_generated_text' field
    current_state['last_generated_text'] = generated_text

    # Save the updated state back to the JSON file
    state_file_path = "data/state.json"
    with open(state_file_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(current_state, f, indent=4)

    return current_state
```

This script assumes that the current state of the Live Directory is stored in a JSON file located at `data/state.json`. The `get_current_state` function retrieves the current state from this file, and the `update_state` function updates it based on the newly generated text.

Would you like to proceed with another file or have any other questions?
